This is an application written with .NET MAUI which tries to implement the screens shown in [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/19153569-Mobile-App-iOS-Android-UI).

## Notes

Android seems to be weaker on some aspects.
You'll notice that the exagons in the last screen are not present in Android, because they led to an app crash.

Morover, setting `HeightRequest` dynamically, after a view render, seems not to have any effect in Android.
